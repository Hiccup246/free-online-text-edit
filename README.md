A simple free online text edit application built using vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML

# Description
While working as a professional software engineer I found myself constantly googling online text editors so I could remove styling from copy-pasted text. I did not particularly like doing this as I was unsure about the data the sites were saving. I could have used an application but I liked having a browser experience. As a result of this frustration and the hunger to do some old-school vanilla HTML, Javascript and CSS I decided to create a text edit application to act as a personal dev tool and hence this project was born.

The application is mobile friendly and consists of a large text area with a background color that is dyslexic and eye-friendly. Underneath the text area there is a footer that contains a positive message and a word and line count to aid in understanding how much content you are copy-pasting. The application has been deployed using Cloudflare.

# Understanding the project
The project is very simple and consists of a `src/index.html` file, fav icons and SEO files. The `src/index.html` is broken into three parts and has an associated `index.css` file to provide styling:
- Head Tag
  - Contains SEO tags and Google Analytics
- Body Tag
  - Contains the structure and content of the page
- Script Tag
  - Contains the necessary javascript to keep track of and update the page about the word and line counts.

# Usage
This project is very simple to get it up and running. After cloning the Github repository all you need to do is use a tool such as a browser to view the `index.html` file.
