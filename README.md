# ✏️ [Free online text edit](https://www.freeonlinetextedit.com/)
A simple free online text edit application built using vanilla javascript, css and html. The purpose of this application is to act as a simple personal dev tool where I can copy and paste text to remove styling.

The project consists of a word and line count to aid in understanding how much content you are copy pasting and includes a background color that is dyslexic and eye friendly.

# Understanding the project
The project is simple and consists of a `src/index.html` file, fav icons and SEO files. The `src/index.html` is broken into three parts and has an associated `index.css` file to provide styling:
- Head Tag
  - Contains SEO tags and Google analytics
- Body Tag
  - Contains the structure and content of the page
- Script Tag
  - Contains the neccessary javscript to keep track of and update the page about the word and line counts.

This structure can be represented by the following diagram:
